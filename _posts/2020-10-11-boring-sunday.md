Will nothing. Forget. Origin of money starts from two people needed to exchange. It is a tool for facilitate exchange. Then the tool is promoted to be an independent form, which is the money. We forget it.

Struggle of powerfuls. Why struggle. Can I stop? When there are too much free tim, one faces with the difficulty of dealing with the free time. I have free time on weekend, and I don't know what to do with it. I read books which is a form of consumption has no different from buying products or eating fooed. Marx pointed out, "surplus" is the origin of capiticalism. Too much reading disables my ability to think independently. The thoughts from books pops up from time to time, which I'm aware of that they are from books. I want to be free from books and see the readlity as presented in front of me. I thought about readers, who will be my readers, what should I write for them? Writing for readers smells bad (Borrowing the phrase from Nietches). I want to express without subjecting to readers. Back to the point of having too much time. I have a job in which 5 days are working days, which 2 days are free to me. The notion of "free" is possible because of "unfree" part (working days). I'm predisposed to do something. I can go out to see the nature and feel free, then I'm too lazy to do it. From my experience, seeing the nature becomes spending a big portion of time driving and got stuck in my mind with thoughts from life, books, and etc, which isn't a feeling of "free" to me. I can read books which is to know and be knowledgeable as praised by whoever. Reading subjects me to thinking in a way that another person has thought, which isn't a feeling of "free" to me.Philosophical books, I read, is too much convoluted. Many points and knowledge are useless. Many of them are detached from the world I'm living it. They are useless. I can use my "free" time to think about how to make money. I just revealed that I want to "think" about it, which is such a terrible way to make money. Not "think" about it can make money. Making money involves actions. But then, waht is it different from the job I have? The "free" disappears again.
