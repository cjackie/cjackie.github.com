### Components of the natural price of a commodity
The components are rent, labor and profit. Rent goes to capitalists, labor goes to the worker, and profits goes to the employer. Price of labor seem the be cost of an average life. Profit is proportional to the capital deployed to make commodity, say a number like 10%, regardless of the price of rent and labor in different places. Rent is called interests or use of money.

### The natural and market price of a commodity.
Causes of changes of supplies:
- Artificial manipulation of price by monopoly
- Trade secret, which is unlikely to keep long.
- Manufacture secret (technological secret) which is likely to last long, even outlive the creator
- Natural causes, applicable to some commodities such as fruits and vegetables

Causes of Demand
- Short term durable commodities can fluctuate more than the durable one.

The increase of revenue due to the increase of market price goes to one of the price components, i.e. rent, labor, and profit. Demanding for produced commodities, increases the profits. Demanding of producing commodities, increases the labor price.

### The wage of labor
- Does not depend on the wealth of the nation. The wage depends on the increase of wealth in the state
1. When the wealth of the nation is increasing, employers compete for labor, then labor wage increase.
2. When the wealth of the nation is stagnant, labor wage is unchanging, or even decreasing
3. When the wealth of nation is decreasing, labor wage is decreasing. Life on the lower rank people are miserable. There are few jobs.
- Wage and population. It is unclear what is cause, and what is effect. The increasing of wage is often accompanied by the increase in the population, and the increase of wage often comes with the decreasing in the population.
- The increase of wage, encourages lower rank to have more children. Children in a nation that is increasing in its wealth can be a fortune to the parents, Whereas, in a stagnant nation, the parents have enought wage only to support his children, so that his children remains as the same working class.

### Of the profits of stock
- Profits of stock is positively related to interests of money.
- Higher wages tend to mean lower profits of stock.
- Profits in the country villlage tend to be bigger than the one in the city.
- Impact of the rise of profits of stock to the price is much bigger than that of wages. The former is a geometric increase to the price, because rise of profit of a stock encourages the increase in all other stock profit. Whereas, rise of wage is a arithmetic growth.
- A society with interest of money high in expense of the profit is decaying and stagnant one.

### Inequalities arise from the nature of the employments themselves
In a society with free choice on the occupations, the wage will go towards the equal, because an occupation with higher wage attract more people and lower its wage eventually to the ordinary one. However, there are higher wages in some occupations, due to:
- Hardship of an occupation
- High expanse on learning the occupation (use of technologies)
- high degree of loyalty needed
- Low probability of success in landing the occupation.
- More inconstancy of the occupation (salary job vs contract job)
