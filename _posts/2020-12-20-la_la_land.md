Isn't being talent a sad thing? The same old story when a Ginus does not want to follow rules. He wants to free and creates in his own will. But there are external powers want to exploit that talent. The power seduces the Ginus with shining things. Ginus may succumb to it, or rebel against it. When Ginus succumbs to it, he becomes a machine subjecting to the will of power, but he gets the shining things. When Ginus rebels against it, he lives in the misery.
