The instinct is secretly the ruling force.

The education cannot change one’s instinct. To change it is to destroy oneself.

The education at best is to conceal oneself.

The education gives a lot of more perspectives. All of these perspective is nourish one’s only perspective, and make one certain/safe against different perspectives.

The ancient instinct is always in it, with all evaluations and ruling powers within oneself.

The ruling instinct is seeking a way to be itself.

The confusion can easily be raised, when the instinct has no way to be itself. It turns violence against itself, and it is destined to die out.

How foolish when one deceives oneself about its origin?

How foolish when one wants to change oneself?

The change is impossible. At best, what one can do, is to transform oneself.
