Beyond Good and Evil is written by Nietzsche. Nietzsche is one of my favorite philosopher. Beyond Good and Evil is a book that is most accessible (easy to understand) book on Nietzsche’s philosophy. I summarize some of his texts in this book (that is to write out his stands on philosophical topics). The summary is *by no mean* the book itself, and the summary is intended to quickly understand Nietzsche thoughts on some topics. The book itself can’t be summarized, because each chapter is a continuous flow of thoughts, which embodies debating, questioning, asserting, refuting, doubting, and turning. It is a flow of text that can’t be reduced without sacrificing its beauty and distort its rhyme, which is the art of Nietzsche.
