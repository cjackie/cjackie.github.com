Why do you think I'm saving a lot? For the sake of saving for you, I chose the cheaper one. But is the question even important? Why you want to spend a large sum of money? Is it a show of strength from your part? Like a lion that is wants to show its strong muscles and sharp teeth? But then, what is the consequence of your morality if I may use the word. That is the morality set out by the greatest messenger from united states culture to enslave. To spend money, to demand happiness with money at any time without limit. The larger the money, the happier one can be. This is morality that set out to keep the poor poor and keep the slavery engine going. Do you want to be in it? Did you make a conscious decision as what you want to be, and what you sign up for? On the other hand, the happiness of being moderate, being sufficient given what you have, from inside yourself, listening to your inner voice, the stress of your body, not something external and outside. Will you be able to listen to it? You can’t listen to the voice. When the morality of "more spending more happiness" comes in, you handle the stress by spending more and consume more. Do you have the stomach to digest what you spend? Do you, can you, will you stuff more in, when you body cries out “no more”? Why don't you listen to your inner voice, that is to keep it moderate and consume reasonably? Do you know yourself?

Maybe concisely, being in poor and insufficient is what you want, what you sign up for, what you want to be, unconsciously.
