Mathematics
This is my attempt to explain what is mathematics.<br>
Mathematics is very beautiful subject. In my view, I think of it as a subject to describe “change”. It describes how numbers change using elegant mathematical concepts. The concept that is most often deployed is function. All concepts presented in mathematics are abstract. And the mathematics is exactly a subject that studies these abstract concepts. These abstract ideas are inspired from many different fields. Let it be engineering, physics, biology and etc. By studying those model or practical results, mathematicians come up with abstract way of reason about it. They call it theorems, which can be quite useful sometimes. Like software engineers, they do abstracts on top of abstracts sometimes, to reason things or make discovery. Mathematician’s rigorous way of thinking can be very useful. They propose theories from definitions. often, we look at theory and dismiss them as unnecessary and useless. But in fact, they could have tremendous impacts on our way of reason and make useful applications. Like many other field, there are many subfields in mathematics, and each of them operates on different level of abstractions because individually we just can’t think of everything. They work together, and form a formidable and beautiful mathematics.
