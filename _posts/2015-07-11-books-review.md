After I watched the movie <i>The Theory of Everything</i>, I was intrigued by stories about Stephen Hawking. Long before watching the movie, I've heard about Stephen Hawking incredible stories, both in academics and personal life. The movie reignited my curiosity about Stephen Hawking. I thought I should read one of his books, so that I could get to know him in fewer layers. That's why I bought <i>A Brief History of Time</i>.

The book lives up to my expectation. Stephen Hawking takes me through a journey of how physics has evolved with time. Through his writing, physics laws are full of lives; these laws are assigned a full interesting history, in which they have been refuted, modified, and proved again. Many different elements are embedded in the history: religions, philosophy, e.t.c. After reading the book, I have a different view about physics. To me, physics is not longer is absolutely true, instead it's a model that only exists in our mind and subject to our sensors, which might not be true.

</div>

<i>The Theory That Would Not Die</i> is recommended by Prof. Petar Djuric. This is book about a Bayesian probability theory. The theory went through many ups and downs in for hundred years, and now it's emerging as an increasingly important theory in science and engineering. The first half part of book is great, which talks how the theory was first stated and then formulated later, and how It was harshly criticized by science community. But in Later part of the book, I think it gets repetitive about usefulness of the theory.

Overall, It's a good book, although, I think the book is little biased. But if you are so passionate about something, it will be hard to not be biased. I recommend reading it, if you like Bayesian probability theory. It will give you a historical view of the theory.
