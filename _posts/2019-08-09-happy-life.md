You seek but you don’t look.

You seek for happiness, but do you know that you have it already?

You are seeking for the happy life, but do you know it does not exist?

If you are seeking it, you will never find it.

The happiness is always with you, you don’t see it with your closed eyes.

God, don’t give me happy life, please give me a hard one.
