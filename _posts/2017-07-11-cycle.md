Man, let me tell you something.<br>
You are not real.<br><!--break-->
Everywhere you go, there is the Cycle. <br>
The tree grows, and produces seeds, and it starts over again.<br>
The whole point is doing it again. <br>
You are stuck in the life cycle.<br>
You are there to repeat whatever was there before.<br>
You cannot decide what you are, and where you are going.<br>
Let me tell you, this truth is the best gift I can give it to you.<br>
You reality goes like this:<br>
You have been doing the thing, <br>
You are doing the thing,<br>
You will do the thing.<br>
You think you can stop doing the thing, <br>
but, you won't, because you want to. <br>
So, you think you are real.<br>
Let me tell you, <br>
You won't do such-and-such is actually you can't do such-and-such.<br>
Behold, there is the Cycle.<br>
