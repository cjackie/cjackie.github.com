## Of the different species of philosophy
- Moral philosophy contributes to the entertainment, instruction, and reformation of mankind.
- Easy and obvious philosophy will always be preferred by mankind above the accurate and abstruse philosophy. Obvious philosophy is more useful and agreeable, which enters into common life. Easy principles actuates men, and reforms their conduct. On the contrary, the abstruse philosophy, being founded on a turn of mind, cannot enter into business and action. The abstruse philosophy vanishes when the philosopher leaves the shade. Abstruse philosophy is painful, fatiguing, uncertain and erroneous. The abstruse philosophy arises from either human vanity, or the craft of popular superstitions.
- The most perfect character lies between a philosopher and an ignorant person. A philosopher is who lives remote from communication with mankind, and is wrapped up in principles and notions equally remote from mankind.
- One advantage from accurate and abstract philosophy, is its subservient to the easy and humane. In every art or profession, that a spirit of accuracy, however acquired, carries all of them nearer their perfection, and renders them more subservient to the interests of society.
- Research may appear painful and fatiguing. Research requires mind and body being endowed with vigorous and florid health, and severe exercise to reap a pleasure from what generality of mankind may seem burdensome and laborious.

## Of the origin of ideas

### Impression and Thought/Idea
Impression and thought are distinguished by their different degrees of force and vivacity on the mind. Impression is a perception by the mind agitated by passion and senses. For example, when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or pleasure of moderate warmth, it is impression that mind of the man perceives. Thought is less vivid and force perceived by the mind. The remembering or imagination of the excessive heat is less force and vivid. The ideas presented in poetry can never paint the objects as splendid as the real landscape.

### Formation of thoughts/ideas
Our thoughts or ideas are confined within narrow limits. The creative power of the mind on forming ideas, are the faculty of compounding, transposing, augmenting, or diminishing the materials afforded to us by the senses and experience. For example, when we think of gold mountain. The idea of gold mountain, is the joining idea of gold and mountain. Another example is virtuous horse. We unit shape of horse and meaning of virtue which we can conceive. When we analyze the thoughts, we always find that they resolve themselves into such simple ideas which were copied from a precedent feeling or sentiment. These feelings or sentiment are impression of the mind. Even the idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise and good Being, arises from reflecting the operation of our own mind. A blind man can form no idea of color, and a deaf man can form no idea of sound. There might be other beings who possesses sense that we donâ€™t have, whose ideas we can never have access to. In short, ideas is derived from impressions/experience.

There is a difference between perception of mind, when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or pleasure, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he recalls his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by his imagination. Faculties of recalling or imagining may mimic or copy the perceptions of the senses, but they can never entirely reach the force of the original sentiment. All colors of poetry, however splendid, can never paint objects in such  a manner as to make the description be taken for a real landskip.

## Of the association of ideas
There are principle of connexion between the different thoughts or ideas of the mind; An idea introduces another idea with a certain degree of method and regularity. There are three principle of connexion of ideas,
1. Resemblance
2. Contiguity
3. Cause and Effect


## Sceptical doubts concerning the operations of the understanding
All the objects of human reason or enquiry may be divided into two kinds
1. Relation of Ideas. Examples of relations of ideas are Geometry, Algebra and Airthmetic; in short, every affirmation, which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain.
2. Matters of Fact. The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible. For exmaple, "the sum will not rise tomorrow" is less intelligible a proposition, than the contrary, "the sun will rise tomorrow". We should in vain to demonstrate ither one is false or true.

### Nature of matter of fact
Reasoning concerning matter of fact is founded on the relations of Cause and Effect. By cause and effect, we can go beyound the evidence of our memory and senses. If you were to ask a man, why he believes any matter of fact, he would give you a reason, and this reason would be some other fact. For example, if you were to ask a man why he believes his frined is in France, he would give you a letter received from his friend as a reason. A man finding a watch on a desert island, would conclude that there had once been men in that island. All our reasonings concerning matter of afct has the same nature. It is constantly supposed, that there is connexion between the present fact and that which is inffered from it. Another example is that the hearing of a rational discourse in the dark assures us of the presence of some person.
