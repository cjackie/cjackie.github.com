## Of the different species of philosophy
- Moral philosophy contributes to the entertainment, instruction, and reformation of mankind.
- Easy and obvious philosophy will always be preferred by mankind above the accurate and abstruse philosophy. Obvious philosophy is more useful and agreeable, which enters into common life. Easy principles actuates men, and reforms their conduct. On the contrary, the abstruse philosophy, being founded on a turn of mind, cannot enter into business and action. The abstruse philosophy vanishes when the philosopher leaves the shade. Abstruse philosophy is painful, fatiguing, uncertain and erroneous. The abstruse philosophy arises from either human vanity, or the craft of popular superstitions.
- The most perfect character lies between a philosopher and an ignorant person. A philosopher is who lives remote from communication with mankind, and is wrapped up in principles and notions equally remote from mankind.
- One advantage from accurate and abstract philosophy, is its subservient to the easy and humane. In every art or profession, that a spirit of accuracy, however acquired, carries all of them nearer their perfection, and renders them more subservient to the interests of society.
- Research may appear painful and fatiguing. Research requires mind and body being endowed with vigorous and florid health, and severe exercise to reap a pleasure from what generality of mankind may seem burdensome and laborious.

## Of the origin of ideas

### Impression and Thought/Idea
Impression and thought are distinguished by their different degrees of force and vivacity on the mind. Impression is a perception by the mind agitated by passion and senses. For example, when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or pleasure of moderate warmth, it is impression that mind of the man perceives. Thought is less vivid and force perceived by the mind. The remembering or imagination of the excessive heat is less force and vivid. The ideas presented in poetry can never paint the objects as splendid as the real landscape.

### Formation of thoughts/ideas
Our thoughts or ideas are confined within narrow limits. The creative power of the mind on forming ideas, are the faculty of compounding, transposing, augmenting, or diminishing the materials afforded to us by the senses and experience. For example, when we think of gold mountain. The idea of gold mountain, is the joining idea of gold and mountain. Another example is virtuous horse. We unit shape of horse and meaning of virtue which we can conceive. When we analyze the thoughts, we always find that they resolve themselves into such simple ideas which were copied from a precedent feeling or sentiment. These feelings or sentiment are impression of the mind. Even the idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise and good Being, arises from reflecting the operation of our own mind. A blind man can form no idea of color, and a deaf man can form no idea of sound. There might be other beings who possesses sense that we donâ€™t have, whose ideas we can never have access to. In short, ideas is derived from impressions/experience.

There is a difference between perception of mind, when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or pleasure, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he recalls his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by his imagination. Faculties of recalling or imagining may mimic or copy the perceptions of the senses, but they can never entirely reach the force of the original sentiment. All colors of poetry, however splendid, can never paint objects in such  a manner as to make the description be taken for a real landskip.
