title: Burst out of the bubble

Each of us is confined to bubbles. The bubble has been there when we were born. The bubble is invisible to our eyes. I can see many people are prisoners of their bubble, however they believe they are not. They believe they are in comfortable homes, and they are free. I want to drag they out and let them see they are in the bubbles, especailly the dear ones to me. I want them to live freely, and I want them be healthy. I don’t want to see them going to a dark path that is only getting darker. Look, there is Sun!! Let’s burst out of the bubble!
