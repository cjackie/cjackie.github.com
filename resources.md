Open courses that have been helpful to me:

1. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">CS 50</a>. A good and comprehesive introduction to computer science. Video lectures are fun to watch and assignments are interesting.
2. <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/" target="_blan">MIT 6.01</a>. A introduction to EE and CS. Unlike CS50, which is specific for computer science, MIT 6.01 is broader and covers both EE and CS. It covers many principles of how engineers solve problems, and gives examples in a friendly way. Many high level concepts for dealing with problems can be very helpful for later courses in engineering. The professor is an interesting person.
3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMzH3tfP6f8&list=PLFE6E58F856038C69" target="_blank">CS 106</a>. An open course offered by Stanford about data structure. It can be taken after a introduction course like [1] and [2]. For people want to learn more about CS, this is the course.
4. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=9D558D49CA734A02" target="_blank">CS 107</a>. The is a course after 3. For those of people who feel CS can be their passion. The course is for them after finishing [3]. One should be able to self-study any CS related subject, after this course. Even for low level embedding stuff and computer architecture, this is a good prep.
5. <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT 6.041</a>. This is a introduction course to probability. This is a great course. It's interesting and thought provoking. Prof John Tsitsiklis does a good job to make probability theory, which is a difficult subject, accessible to students.
6. <a href="http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home" target="_blank">Stat 110</a>. Another introduction course to probability. But this is more conprehesive and broader. I didn't watch all of it, but from ones I watched, I felt It was more difficult than [5]. So if you like chanlleges, take this one as the introduction course to probability instead of [5], however, I don't think it will matter that much in long run. Prof Joe Blitzstein gives many interesting examples of story about probability, which I think is very interesting.
7. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A89DCFA6ADACE599" target="_blank">CS 229</a>. A graduate course on machine learning. It's chanlleging but rewarding. It gives broad introduce to machine learning. Many different algorithms are presented. It's good start for getting to the field.
8. <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/540-2013/lectures.html" target="_black">CPSC 540</a>. Another course about machine learning. I like this more. Machine learning has evolved alot and is still making progress. This one is more recent, and it covers the another approach that [7] almost entirely omits, which is the bayesian approach. This one is very relevent to the research I do for summer 2015. Topics like MCMC, bayesian inference and so on.
