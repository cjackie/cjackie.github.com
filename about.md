title: About
---

I'm a sophomore at Stony Brook University, major in Computer Engineering. I started programming two years ago after I took an online introductory course in computer programming. Ironically, the main reason why I took that class was to learn about English. But after I took that class, I was drawn to computer programming. I started to learn more about it, and later I decided to pursue it as my career.</br>
I have a wide range of interests - electronics, computer hardware, and computer programming. I love my major, because I can learn and then create real stuff that benefits other people. Everytime when I finish a project, I feel fulfill and proud. That's what keep me continue learn more and get better.</br>
Right now, the topic I'm most interested in is data. These days everyone is talking about buzzwords like big data, data-mining and so on without actually knowing what are they. I want to take a journey to uncover what are they and how to utilize them. In an era where data grows exponentially, I think it's crucial to be able to understand data and make best use of it. I have a strong background in programming, but I don't know to analyze data, which is one thing I'm currently working to improve on.</br>
