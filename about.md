I’m a rising junior at Stony Brook University, and I major in Computer Engineering. I like engineering and mathematics. Right now I’m focusing on learning mathematics as much as I can; study how they describe systems, which can be physical physical phenomenon, politics, financial system, and even psychology. Mathematics can be utilized to engineer a system, extract information, make predictions and many more.
