I'm a rising junior at Stony Brook University, and I major in Computer Engineering. I like mathmatics and engineering. Right now I'm focusing on learning as much as mathmatics and study how they are describing systems, which can be real world objects, society, politics, financial system, and so on. Mathmatics can be utilized to engineer a system, extract information, analyze data, make preditions and many more.
